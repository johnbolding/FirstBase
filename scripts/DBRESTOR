:
: DBRESTOR - shell script used to restore a dirty database.
:          The idea is to move the good, backup copies of the
:          dbase.cdb and dbase.map files from their storage area,
:          either off line, or on the disk somewhere, BACK to the
:          original location.
:
:          Then, the dbrestor program can use the database log
:          to recover the database almost to the crash point.
:
:          If this script is changed, the matching DBDUMP script
:          will need modifications also.
:
:          Assumption is that the backup copies of the database are
:          very clean and passed a dbcheck before storage.
