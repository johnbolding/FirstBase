.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dblgen
generates a set of \fIFirstBase\fP labels using
a \fIFirstBase\fP label dictionary defined via 
\fIdbdlbl\fP(1).
This label dictionary is used to determine which fields are to appear
where on the label.
.PP
The \fB-b\fP
flag will run the \fIFirstBase\fP tool in batch mode, suitable for shell
scripts.
This mode produces no output on the terminal, thus can also be used
when running the process in the background.
The \fB-y\fP flag will run the tool at the terminal without pausing to ask
the user if existing files can be destroyed and without displaying
a 'picture' of the requested task.
.PP
\fIDblgen\fP(1)
first displays an image of what the labels will look like and where the
print image file will go. The user has a chance to abort here.
The labels may be generated from one to four up (across the top), as
specified in the label dictionary. The width of each label is
derived from the label dictionary also. See
\fIdbdlbl\fP(1)
for more information on the label generator dictionary.
.PP
The \fB-n\fP argument line switch is used to turn off the printing of the
statistics label. Without this flag, a statistics label showing how many
labels were printed is produced as the last label.
.PP
The \fB-H\fP and \fB-T\fP
argument line switches are used to tune the number of blanklines
printed \fIbetween\fP each label, either as head_lines or tail_lines.
Using this feature, printer fonts
requiring more vertical spacing can be utilized as needed.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the label print file already exists 
\fIDblgen\fP(1)
will pause and ask permission to overwrite it.
.sp 1
This tool uses a \fIFirstBase\fP index to generate the output from the database
in a particular order.
If this index is detected to be out of date or non-existent, it is
regenerated \fIautomatically\fP.
