#
# Cdb keyboard map for intraline editing and standard input signals.
#
# Each key definition is set using a line of the form
#
#        setkey "sequence" action
#
# with components separated by white space of some kind (spaces/tabs).
# A sequence is a set of characters within double quotes.
# An action is a Cdb action. See keyboard(5).
#
# meta characters: \^ = Control , \e = Escape, \\ = \  \^? = DEL
#
#
# These bindings were culled from GNU Emacs and FrameMaker and are
# released as the "standard" Cdb bindings.
