	The database you are attempting to use was not properly shut down. 
	Most likely, this happened due to a machine failure during the use 
	of the FirstBase database editor, dbedit.

	To recover this database, you may try using dbclean(1), or  
        dbdump(8) and dbrestor(8).

	We suggest reading the FirstBase User's Guide for further information.
