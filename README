FirstBase
---------

FirstBase is an open source RDBMS and Application Builder.
It consists of a large set of end user programs designed to create,
manipulate, scan, organize, view, and format relational database and
database systems under the Unix/Linux environment.

The FirstBase tools are used to produce and maintain information tracking
applications and systems of data based on relational databases while still
maintaining the flexibility of Unix/Linux software tools.

Using a Unix/Linux tools approach creates an easily learned, dynamic,
and highly productive database management platform.

FirstBase features a unique approach to building database
applications. Using full screen dictionary and data editors, database
structures are defined and records of information are modified.

When desired, custom data views and entry forms can be created, set of data
can be organized using any combinations of fields, and tabular or free form
printouts can be generated.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

See the file INSTALL for generalized installation instructions.
FirstBase uses the GNU `configure' method of generating system
dependent Makefiles in each source directory.

Note that the default installation is to install /usr/local/firstbase
as the FIRSTBASEHOME directory, with binaries in $FIRSTBASEHOME/bin,
libraries in $FIRSTBASEHOME/lib and scripts in $FIRSTBASEHOME/scripts.

Basically, this is something like

   ./configure
   make
   make install

If the `configure' script fails to generate workable Makefiles
on your system, please try and work out the options needed
for your particular system so I can fix them.

After installation, one environment variable needs to be added, 
and two PATH areas need to be modified.

FIRSTBASEHOME
-------------

The environment variable FIRSTBASEHOME needs to be added.

If you are using a c-shell style shell, use something like the following:

   setenv FIRSTBASEHOME /usr/local/firstbase

If you are using a Bourne type of shell, use something like this:

   FIRSTBASEHOME=/usr/local/firstbase
   export FIRSTBASEHOME

PATH
----

The PATH of each user needs to be modified to locate the firstbase
binaries and scripts. Using the FIRSTBASEHOME environment variable
is the best way to do this.

If you are using a c-shell style shell, use something like the following:

   set path=( $path $FIRSTBASEHOME/bin $FIRSTBASEHOME/scripts )

If you are using a Bourne type of shell, use something like this:

   PATH=$PATH:$FIRSTBASEHOME/bin:$FIRSTBASEHOME/scripts
   export PATH


MANPATH
-------

One last path to tweak if you want the man pages to be
available using the man command:

Add $FIRSTBASEHOME/man to the MANPATH environment variable.


Demonstration Applications
--------------------------

At this point, the `fb' command will be in /usr/local/bin
and should be usable. Try it. From the FirstBase MAIN menu, choose the
Application Menu by typing `app' and a <RETURN>.

You can play around with the two database areas, Rolodex and Phone,
and the sample source code area. Each has a menu.
The Rolodex application demonstrates most every aspect of getting
at data stored in a FirstBase database.

For documentation on FirstBase, start with the Postscript manual
located in $FIRSTBASEHOME/doc/fb-manual.ps.
